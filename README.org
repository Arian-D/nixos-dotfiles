#+TITLE: Dot files
My NixOS, Emacs, and XMonad dot files.

Feel free to copy snippets, or use the config in it's entirety.

* Installation
Assuming you have cloned the repo and ~$PWD~ is the repo, you can go
through these steps. The order is structured like this because some of
these packages /may/ depend on the previous ones.
** NixOS
This repository is a [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][flake]], meaning that among all the cool features,
you don't have to copy the config to =/etc/nixos/=. Running the
following should be enough to get your NixOS system up and running.
#+begin_src bash 
sudo make switch
#+end_src
** Emacs
Symlink the =emacs= directory to your home.
#+begin_src bash
ln -s ./emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
** XMonad
Symlink the =XMonad= directory to your home.
#+begin_src bash
ln -s ./xmonad ~/.xmonad
#+end_src
