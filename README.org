#+TITLE: Dot files
My NixOS, Emacs, and XMonad dot files.

These configurations are my personal ones, and they may not pertain to
your personal needs. Feel free to use them or copy snippets for your
configs.

* Installation
Assuming you have cloned the repo and ~$PWD~ is the repo, you can go
through these steps. The order is structured like this because some of
these packages /may/ depend on the previous ones.
